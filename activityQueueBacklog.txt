need: help activity that outputs information about built-in commands, list of aliases and what they expand to, as well as list of pre- and postReqs

need: search-products, search-accountProducts, search-gameDetails, etc. + alias "search" (all together, each operation lists separate results)

design alternatives:
- (no - requires deserialization) use only text fields for search
- (no - would hit too much of internal data) use serialized entry
- (yes, and would be required for frontends as well) build search index with viewModels and new activity (update-searchIndex, should be postReq for many activities)
- search outputs a list of productCore (id,title)
- this might require to add Results to ActivityStatus - not sure if string, ProductCore yet (would be great to have the ProductCore)

need: activityStatuses reported from the activityQueue should present clear results. Need to think more about how the queue affects result output - e.g. does it happen at the end (likely)? after every activity in the queue (not likely)? how this affects current results presentation, etc. - need to think of this through the context of aliases (e.g. search), doesn't make sense to show and remove intermediate information - would be great to collate end results in meaningful way
