Backend

- check if newUpdated should also add products that didn't exist to updated

- guard product files and validation files download with the throttleController, or better yet introduce rate limiter based on URL and time between requests add it to networkController so that it's transparent for the users

- Change validation controller to use file, validationFile

- introduce validation reports with full details on validation for the file

- repair controller?
	- validate full file and return validation results with all failing chunks and specific validation problems
	- consolidate validation report and schedule repair
	- refactor download controller to download range

- serve data and frontend files via http

- current task activities are monolithic - consider breaking them apart somehow for testability

- unit tests

Frontend:

- es6 modules, fetch, promises, custom properties
- move to a new data model with data controllers and dynamic data loading
- Use notifications API on web client view on updates
- motion
- mobile layouts
