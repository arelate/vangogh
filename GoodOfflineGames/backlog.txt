Backend

- rename taskStatus -> status

- put new taskStatus in network to good use and perhaps log actual requests for debug purposes
- definitely use taskStatus in authorization controller to log status of authorization without exposing any sensitive data

- Change validation controller to use file, validationFile

- introduce validation reports with full details on validation for the file

- repair controller?
	- validate full file and return validation results with all failing chunks and specific validation problems
	- consolidate validation report and schedule repair
	- refactor download controller to download range

- serve data and frontend files via http

- current task activities are monolithic - consider breaking them apart somehow for testability

- unit tests

Frontend:

- es6 modules, fetch, promises, custom properties
- move to a new data model with data controllers and dynamic data loading
- Use notifications API on web client view on updates
- motion
- mobile layouts
