Backend

- cleanup dependency graph: there shouldn't be a reference from Interface to Models (e.g. GOG.Interface to GOG.Models)

- fix authorization flow issues - two-factor auth doesn't seem to be detected

- change functional controllers to work on product model type and have activities loop updates using those

- add status progress controller to calculate ETAs etc

- update progress for move to recycle bin

- in the activity cycle dump status json on fatal error

- repair controller:
	- enumerate validation reports
	- create validationReportController to determine if product is valid, skip valid products
	- introduce few ways to repair - chunks repair => patch, validationFileIsNotValid => try simple known fixes

- serve data and frontend files via http or better yet websockets server

- current task activities are monolithic - consider breaking them apart somehow for testability

- unit tests

Frontend:

- es6 modules, fetch, promises, custom properties
- move to a new data model with data controllers and dynamic data loading
- Use notifications API on web client view on updates
- motion
- mobile layouts
