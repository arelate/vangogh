Backend

- make directories settings more resilient to empty values

- protect critical data (hashes, indexes) with copy operation - don't write data over that can be interrupted

- change functional controllers to work on product model type and have activities loop updates using those

- introduce few ways to repair - chunks repair => patch, validationFileIsNotValid => try simple known fixes

- serve data and frontend files via http or better yet websockets server

- persist cookies from session to session (.net core 2.0?), or at least allow injecting cookies from the browser session

- add data validation step that uses hashes and validates md5

- unit tests

Frontend:

- es6 modules, fetch, promises, custom properties
- move to a new data model with data controllers and dynamic data loading
- Use notifications API on web client view on updates
- motion
- mobile layouts
